      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        While Packet Loss Gaming aims to be a relaxed,
        and fun environment, our history has shown us that to maintain
        this environment, and prevent toxicity in our community, we need a
        simple enforceable code of conduct.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar to the phrase "nobody is above the law", nobody is above
        the code of conduct in Packet Loss Gaming. That <em>especially</em>
        true of our adminstrators who are entrusted with enforcing this
        code of conduct.
      </p>

      <h2>Member Conduct</h2>

      <p>
        The general rule is <strong>be respectful</strong>.
        While this is something you should keep in mind in your day to day life,
        we think it's especially true of your online life. People that you will
        meet will be coming from all kinds of different backgrounds, with their
        own experiences -- some of them good, some of them bad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just try and keep this in mind and if someone's doing something that's
        bothering you, or is otherwise offending you in some way, let them know,
        and if you're on the otherside make an effort to take their concerns
        seriously.
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, there are a few things that are always, in every case,
        <strong><u>100% unacceptable</u></strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Nazism</li>
          <li>Racism</li>
          <li>Sexism</li>
          <li>Homophobia</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, attempts to get around group policies, or harass others
        via abusing group policies (e.x. trolling) shall not be tolerated.
        We do not want to hear about how you're "offended" by something
        that no reasonable person would be offended by.
      </p>

      <h2>Admin Conduct</h2>

      <p>
        Admins should be keepers of the peace, nothing more, nothing less.
        In the Packet Loss Gaming group, Admins must follow the same rules
        as any other member.
      </p>

      <p>
        Admins are entrusted with power to enforce this code of conduct, and
        all other group policies. Admins should use their given powers
        sparingly, only when absolutely necessary. Admin powers should
        never be used on any system for any selfish purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Explicitly, this means that admins should not use their powers to do
        any of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Troll</li>
          <li>Give themselves unfair advantages (cheat)</li>
          <li>Act in bad faith</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </PrimaryContainer>
