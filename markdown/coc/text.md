## Member Conduct

The general rule is <strong>be respectful</strong>.
While this is something you should keep in mind in your day to day life,
we think it's especially true of your online life. People that you will
meet will be coming from all kinds of different backgrounds, with their
own experiences -- some of them good, some of them bad.

Just try and keep this in mind and if someone's doing something that's
bothering you, or is otherwise offending you in some way, let them know,
and if you're on the otherside make an effort to take their concerns
seriously.

That said, there are a few things that are always, in every case,
**_100% unacceptable_**:
- Nazism
- Racism
- Sexism
- Homophobia

Additionally, attempts to get around group policies, or harass others
via abusing group policies (e.x. trolling) shall not be tolerated.
We do not want to hear about how you're "offended" by something
that no reasonable person would be offended by.

## Admin Conduct</h2>

Admins should be keepers of the peace, nothing more, nothing less.
In the Packet Loss Gaming group, Admins must follow the same rules
as any other member.

Admins are entrusted with power to enforce this code of conduct, and
all other group policies. Admins should use their given powers
sparingly, only when absolutely necessary. Admin powers should
never be used on any system for any selfish purpose.

Explicitly, this means that admins should not use their powers to do any of
the following:
- Troll
- Give themselves unfair advantages (cheat)
- Act in bad faith
